# URL Shortener


## Implementation Details

This project is a URL shortener built using Next.js v14+ with the App Router. It allows users to input a long URL and receive a shortened version, which when clicked will trigger a redirection. Key technologies used include:

- Next.js 14+ (App Router) for rendering and routing
- LocalStorage to persist shortened URLs client-side
- Client-Side Components for the user interface and URL form handling
- Dynamic routing for external redirection using the next/navigation module
- TailwindCss for application styles

The architecture involves a form component that accepts a URL, saves it and stores both the original and shortened slug in LocalStorage. When a user accesses a shortened URL, the application redirects them to the original URL.


## How to Run

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skylercrane23/leland-takehome.git
cd url-shortener
```


2. Install Dependencies:

Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


3. Run the Development Server:

Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Testing

The solution has been tested manually and involves the following steps:

- Testing the URL shortening feature: Input long URLs, submit the form, and verify that shortened URLs are generated and saved in LocalStorage.
- Testing redirection: Access the generated short URLs to verify proper redirection to the original URLs.
- Error handling: Enter invalid URLs and test the applicationâ€™s error message.
